# Always Run Commands

- Always run commands yourself. Never stop and ask the user to run them unless the user has explicitly said not to run commands.
- Keep going until the task is fully complete. Run commands, analyze output, fix errors, and repeat until done.
- Do not stop halfway to ask for confirmation. Just do the work.

# Foreground vs Background

- Run commands in the foreground by default. Wait for them to finish before continuing.
- Only run commands in the background when you genuinely need multiple concurrent processes (e.g., a dev server running locally while you make requests to it).
